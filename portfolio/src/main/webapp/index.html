            <p> <strong> A little bit about me: </strong> </p>
            <p> I grew up in India and moved to London with 
                my parents in 2018. I just finished my first 
                year studying Computer Science at Queen Mary University
                of London and joined Google as a STEP intern. I have always
                been curious about how we can train our computer to do things
                that our brain does and so I planned to pursue Computer 
                Science as my major. Before this(internship) I did work part-time
                as an administrator at Ark tuition centre and was responsible for
                the smooth functioning of the centre/ parent-authorities communication.
                Tracing back, I was also a part of the Vodafone Code Like a Girl program,
                which gave me a chance to visit their headquarters and work on a group
                project. I also volunteered at the Anime League Gaming Con., which was
                super fun and I got to meet a lot of people.
            </p>
            <p> 
                My all time favorite TV show is Friends (ikr cliche XD).
                I like learning new things, let it be some new crafts, 
                recipes or latest tech and experiment with it. Besides that 
                I love travelling and exploring new places and this quarantine
                has been taking a toll on me (smh). Overall, I’m a fun-loving
                person who takes a lot of pictures (selfies mostly :P, check
                out my gallery) and has passion to follow her dreams.
