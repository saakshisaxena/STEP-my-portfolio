                    <p style="font-size: larger;"> <strong><em> A little bit about me: </em></strong> </p>
                    <p> I grew up in India and moved to London with 
                        my parents in 2018. I just finished my first 
                        year studying Computer Science at Queen Mary University
                        of London and joined Google as a STEP intern. I have always
                        been curious about how we can train our computer to do things
                        that our brain does and so I planned to pursue Computer 
                        Science as my major. Before this(internship) I did work part-time
                        as an administrator at Ark tuition centre and was responsible for
                        the smooth functioning of the centre/ parent-authorities communication.
                        Tracing back, I was also a part of the Vodafone Code Like a Girl program,
                        which gave me a chance to visit their headquarters and work on a group
                        project. I also volunteered at the Anime League Gaming Con., which was
                        super fun and I got to meet a lot of people.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        My all time favorite TV show is Friends (ikr cliche XD).
                        I like learning new things, let it be some new crafts, 
                        recipes or latest tech and experiment with it. Besides that 
                        I love travelling and exploring new places and this quarantine
                        has been taking a toll on me (smh). Overall, I’m a fun-loving
                        person who takes a lot of pictures (selfies mostly :P, check
                        out my gallery) and has passion to follow her dreams.

                        3) Traffic Lights Controller

                        This project is to implement traffic light controller by integrating 
                        electronics with computer programming. It can be extended to interface 
                        with other devices forming the basis of IoT.  

                        <p>This project constitutes of two parts

                            Design and implementation of software for traffic light controller algorithm
                        </p>
                        <p>Hardware Platform: Raspberry Pi3 Model B.

                            4) Set Theorem Prover

                            Theorem prover is a tool to verify various set theorems. It can be used by 
                            students/examiners/mathematicians to confirm if the set equations are valid or 
                            not. It’s also a fun way of learning core functionalities of sets. It’s an extension
                            of “Set Calculator”(a mini project before this) which has a “Theorem Proving Engine” to
                            calculate the set operations and validate whether the operations are equal or not. It has an
                            easy menu driven interface to take user input and validate the Set theorems (both basic and compound
                            operations).

                            <p>Platforms/Languages: Java, OOPS, Data structures (Hash set), BlueJ Java Editor. </p>

                            <p>Key Characteristics:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Supports core set operations (Union, Intersection, Not)</li>

                                    <li>Supports compound set operations (For example: NOT(AUB) = NOT(A) n NOT(B))</li>

                                    <li>Uses Java Set library (Hash sets)</li>

                                    <li>Menu driven, extensible architecture, modular approach, reusable functions</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5) Website creation 

                            Bucket list is a website which is meant to be a socializing platform 
                            for all age groups to share their experiences with other explorers, 
                            suggest the best and connect with people who share the same interests. 
                            It is mostly a front end based creation which is under improvements.

                            <p>Platforms/ Languages: JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Github.</p>
